## <a id="overview"></a>Overview
The Chain Expander example demonstrates the different concepts explained in the [Decoding chains - Part 1](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/article/elektron-article-1) article published on the [Thomson Reuters Developer Community](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com). This application is based on the Java edition of the Elektron Message API and is designed in a way that makes it easly reusable in your own source code application.

## <a id="prerequisites"></a>Prerequisites

Required software components:

* [Elektron Message API](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/elektron/elektron-sdk-java) (1.0.8 or greater) - Thomson Reuters interface to the Elektron Market Data environment
* [JDK 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) - Java Development Kit - version 8

## <a id="application-design"></a> Application design
The source code of this example application has been designed for easy reuse. It is made of two distinct parts:

### The EMA Chain Toolkit
This is a reusable module that implements the complete chain decoding logic and algorithms explained in the [Decoding chains - Part 1](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/article/elektron-article-1) article. These features have been isolated in the EMA Chain Toolkit contained in the *com.thomsonreuters.platformservices.ema.utils.chain* package. The source code of this package is available in GitHub and ready for reuse. It can be integrated in your application project as is. The toolkit also comes with a Javadoc that fully describes the exposed API. The [Decoding Chains - Part 2](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/article/elektron-article-2) article explains how to use it.

### The ChainExpander
This is the example application itself. It is made of a single source file that demonstrates the EMA Chain Toolkit capabilities and how to use them. The application starts by creating an EMA *OmmConsumer* and uses it with the toolkit to expand different kind of chains. Chains are expanded one by one in 10 individual steps. Before each step an explanatory text is displayed and you are prompted to press *\<Enter>* to start the step.

The *ChainExpander* application also implements utility methods that are used to dispatch the *OmmConsumer* in different situations: until a chain is complete, until the user presses *\<Enter>* or until a certain amount of time is elapsed.

**Note:** If you do not know yet about the Elektron Message API (EMA) and how to program and EMA consumer application I recommend you to follow this [EMA Quick Start](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/elektron/elektron-sdk-java/quick-start?content=8656&type=quick_start) and these [EMA Tutorials](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/elektron/elektron-sdk-java/learning).

## <a id="demonstrated-features"></a>Demonstrated features
The Chain Expander application demonstrates the following features of the EMA Chain Toolkit:

* **Step 1:** Builds and opens the Dow Jones chain (0#.DJI). Waits for the chain to complete using the *isComplete()* method. Gets and display the chain elements.
* **Step 2:** Builds and opens the Dow Jones chain. Leverages the *ChainCompleteFunction* functional interface to wait for completion, to get the chain elements and to display them.
* **Step 3:** Builds and opens the Dow Jones chain. Leverages the *ElementAddedFunction* functional interface to display new chain elements as soon as they are decoded.
* **Step 4:** Same as Step 2 but skip the summary links (first link .DJI in the case of the Dow Jones).
* **Step 5:** Opens a very long chain (NASDAQ Basic) using the default algorithm. The NASDAQ Basic chain (0#UNIVERSE.NB) contains more than 8000 elements and may take more than 30 seconds to open with the default algorithm.
* **Step 6:** Same as Step 5 but with the "Name Guessing" optimized algorithm. This time the chain takes 1 second or so to open.
* **Step 7:** Opens the "NYSE Active Volume leaders" tile (.AV.O) with updates and display any change that happens thanks to the *ElementAddedFunction*, *ElementChangedFunction* and *ElementRemovedFunction* functional interfaces. Tiles are chains that updates very frequently. .AV.O updates often when the US market is opened.
* **Step 8:** Opens and displays the Japanese Equity Market recursive chain (0#JP-EQ).  This chain is a 3 levels depth chain of chains.
* **Step 9:** Same as Step 8 but with a maximum depth of 2 levels.
* **Step 10:** Opens a chain that doesnâ€™t exit. Leverages the *ChainErrorFunction* functional interface to catch and display the error.

## <a id="using-the-ema-chain-toolkit"></a>Using the EMA Chain Toolkit
For more details about the EMA Chain Toolkit usage, please refer to the [Decoding Chains - Part 2](https://developers.thomsonreuters.com/article/elektron-article-2) article and the EMA Chain Toolkit javadoc. 

## <a id="building-the-chainexpander"></a>Building the ChainExpander

This package includes some convenient files which will enable the developer to quickly build and run the example application. These scripts depend on the *JAVA_HOME* and *ELEKTRON_JAVA_HOME* environment variables. These variables must be set appropriately before you run any of the *build* or *run* scripts.
* *JAVA_HOME* must be set with the root directory of your JDK 8 environment.
* *ELEKTRON_JAVA_HOME* must be set with the root directory of your (EMA) Elektron Java API installation

Once these variables setup, run the *build.bat* or the *build.ksh* script to build the application.

## <a id="running-the-chainexpander"></a>Running the ChainExpander
**Before you start the application** you must configure the *EmaConfig.xml file* to specify the host name of the server (the TREP or Elektron platform) to which the EMA connects. This is set thanks to the value of the *\<ChannelGroup>\<ChannelList>\<Channel>\<Host>* node. This value can be a remote host name or IP address.

To start the ChainExpander run the *run.bat* or the *run.ksh* script. These scripts depend on the *JAVA_HOME* and *ELEKTRON_JAVA_HOME* environment variables that must have been defined for the build scripts.

    | This example application illustrates the concepts explained in the          |
    | "Decoding chains with the Elektron Message API" article published on the    |
    | Thomson Reuters Developer Portal (URL). More specifically, this application |
    | demonstrates how to use the EMA chain toolkit that implements the different |
    | concepts, algorithms and optimizations described in the article.            |
    |                                                                             |
    | The EMA chain toolkit is exposed by the com.thomsonreuters.platformservices |
    | .ema.utils.chain package.                                                   |
    | The application starts by creating an EMA OmmConsumer and uses it with the  |
    | toolkit to expand a number of different chains, demonstrating the           |
    | implemented capabilities. The chains are expanded one by one in 10          |
    | individual steps. For each step an explanatory text is displayed and you    |
    | are prompted to press <Enter> to start the step.                            |

      . be different for other chains and depends on the display template used by
      . the chain. For example, it's 2 for the British FTSE 100 (0#.FTSE), 6 for
      . the Italian FTSE 100 (0#.FTMIB) and 6 for the French CAC40 (0#.FCHI).

**Q: When I build or run the application, it fails with an error like:**

    The system cannot find the path specified

**A:** The JAVA_HOME environment variable is not set, or set to the wrong path. See [Building the ChainExpander](#building-the-chainexpander) section above.

**Q: The application is stuck after the *">>> Creating the OmmConsumer"* message is displayed.**

After a while the application displays an error like: 

      ERROR - Can't create the OmmConsumer because of the following error: login failed (timed out after waiting 45000 milliseconds) for 10.2.43.49:14002)

**A:** Verify that you properly set the *<host>* parameter in the EmaConfig.xml file (see [Running the ChainExpander](#running-the-chainexpander) for more). 
Ultimately, ask your TREP administrator to help you to investigate with TREP monitoring tools like adsmon.
